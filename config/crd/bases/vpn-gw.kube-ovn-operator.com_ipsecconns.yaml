              proposals:
                description: A proposal is a set of algorithms. For non-AEAD algorithms
                  this includes IKE an encryption algorithm, an integrity algorithm,
                  a pseudo random function (PRF) and a Diffie-Hellman key exchange
                  group. For AEAD algorithms, instead of encryption and integrity
                  algorithms a combined algorithm is used. With IKEv2 multiple algorithms
                  of the same kind can be specified in a single proposal, from which
                  one gets selected. For IKEv1 only one algorithm per kind is allowed
                  per proposal, more algorithms get implicitly stripped. Use multiple
                  proposals to offer different algorithm combinations with IKEv1.
                  Algorithm keywords get separated using dashes. Multiple proposals
                  may be separated by commas. The special value default adds a default
                  proposal of supported algorithms considered safe and is usually
                  a good choice for interoperability. [default]
